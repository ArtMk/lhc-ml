# Machine Learning Tutorial for Physics at the LHC

## Hello hello!

This is a jupyter notebook series introducing beginner concepts of machine learning and its application in Higgs physics research using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) package for python specifically taylored to the applications of the CMS group of the Institute for Experimental Physics UHH. This tutorial, so to speak, is very much based on the "Online Course: Machine Learning for Physicists 2021" which is a thorough lecture series by Florian Marquard. You can find the full recorded lectures, tutorials and slides [here](

Keras is an open-source machine learning framework built on the foundation of Tensorflow 2. It is increadibly versitile and is chosen by many scientific organizations like CERN and NASA for its ease of use and applicability.

The series will cover everything from what a neural network is to, how to perform cuts on given data and make an event selection and **INSERT TOPIC HERE**. The jupyter notebook environment is very convenient for quick scripting and trying out ideas so you are encouraged to play around with the given code and edit it to your wants and needs!

The first two notebooks will not dive into Keras just yet but will introduce fundamental concepts of the structure and nature of neural networks using native python and numpy objects only. This will allow us to develop an understanding of what is going on behind the scenes. Later on, many of the finicky details of neural networks will be managed by Keras such that we can focus on the physics problem at hand and can turn our full attention to the research to be conducted!
